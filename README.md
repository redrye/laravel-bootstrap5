## About Laravel Bootstrap5

Bootstrap5 is a very powerful front-end framework capable of scaling web applications with ease. Because of the new syntax of Laravel 7+, this provides a unique way of building custom components that are much easier than defining all the classes of an HTML tag for each instance. As a result, the expressive, elegant syntax of Laravel is combined with the responsiveness of Bootstrap, giving you the best of both worlds.
